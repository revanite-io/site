    <p class="text-center">The Revanite Registry is a source for you to retrieve certified compliant infrastructure as code modules with confidence.</p>
    <p class="text-center">In the past, compliance required infrastructure teams to import insecure-by-default modules, then work with security specialists to identify and implement an ideal configuration state— sometimes involving days or weeks before a service is ready for production.</p>
    <p class="text-center">Within Revanite Registry, modules are only approved for consumption <i>after</i> an automated validator is able to demonstrate that the deployed resource is compliant with the Common Cloud Controls standard.</p>
    <p class="text-center">Instead of requiring hundreds of man hours from managed service providers to map features to controls, or requiring internal developers to maintain secure configurations, Revanite Registry expedites everything in one place.</p>
